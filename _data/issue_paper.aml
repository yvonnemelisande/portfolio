This issue paper looks at reference service provided to a subset of the conspiracist researcher archival user group, suspicious researchers. The data for this study come from interviews with six reference personnel at three institutions. Although too limited to be generalizable, the data indicate a need for flexible guidelines for practitioners who encounter this user group on a regular basis.
