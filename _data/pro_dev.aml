My research area--conspiracy theorists and their research practices--has a multitude of possible policy implications, including (but not limited to): platform politics, misinformation and disinformation, epistemic communities and information seeking, and critical information literacy. I initially became interested in conspiracy theorizing as a research topic when I realized that very little had been written about the topic within Information Studies. This was surprising to me, as IS literature--specifically, work on information literacy, epistemic communities, institutional power, and information seeking--has so much to say to scholarship on conspiracy theories. Coming from a variety of disciplines, including psychology, media studies, and philosophy, the study of conspiracy theory often asks similar questions about power, epistemology, trust, and truth. My work is some of the first to address conspiracy theorizing from the vantage point of Information Studies, and I would ideally like to continue furthering this research as my career develops.

Once I successfully defend my dissertation in the Spring of 2021, I plan to complete a two-year research post-doctoral position at one of the many research centers in the U.S., such as Data & Society or the MIT Media Lab. A research-based postdoc will allow me to learn and become experienced in different research methods, introduce me to doing research on a team, and make it possible to conduct research that has policy applications. After completing this postdoc, I will choose between one of two paths: a non-academic policy-related researcher position, or tenure-track professorship in an Information Studies program.

The former choice, a nonacademic policy-related researcher position, entails a less concrete plan than the latter. The advantage of going with this career trajectory would be that I could take part in making tangible policy changes in a hands-on way. This could mean working as a government researcher, for a think tank of some kind, or in the technology industry.

If I decide on the latter, I will continue developing my research agenda and goals, which will likely include an expansion of my dissertation work. This will turn into my first book, which I aim to publish within my first three years of assistant professorship.

Although I hope to find a research-focused position, I am also anticipating teaching students who will be earning their Master of Library and Information Science. In my time at UCLA, I have taken many classes with fellow MLIS students, as I have worked toward obtaining the degree myself. I have been consistently challenged by my peers’ thoughtful curiosity and criticism, and would consider myself lucky to be able to guide more cohorts through the intellectual and practical disciplinary training necessary for the MLIS. With the thoughtful help and support of multiple IS faculty and administrators, I was the first student—under the new system—to successfully petition UCLA’s Graduate Division to obtain the MLIS and PhD concurrently. I consider myself extremely fortunate to be able to work towards obtaining both degrees, and taking MLIS classes alongside my PhD coursework has significantly expanded my view of the profession, the challenges my peers will have to face in their professions, and the changes they will be making to the field. I have had the chance to work with several cohorts of MLIS students at UCLA, and they are invariably critical of the status quo, technically skilled, and intellectually adept. Beyond the fact that attaining an MLIS will give me the knowledge I need to teach in an information studies program, working closely with a wide variety of fellow MLIS students has educated me as to what their needs are, and what kind of instruction they find most useful.

In my time as an MLIS student, I have had the opportunity to take classes in both archival and library studies, giving me excellent grounding in both aspects of information studies work. I found it particularly enlightening to take IS 260, Description and Access, with Jonathan Furner, and IS 438B, Archival Description and Access Systems, with Kathy Carbone, the following quarter. Although 260 was a core course, and 438B an elective, the former seemed more in line with librarianship, and the latter, of course, with archives.  Both classes focused on higher-level theoretical questions (what is information? Why do we need knowledge organization?; what is an archives/ fonds/ finding aid?), as well as more practical skills practitioners need to know in order to conduct their day-to-day work (learning how to use metadata schema like DublinCore and collections management systems like CONTENTdm; working with software like ArchivesSpace to build a finding aid and describing a collection using DACS elements). Taking these classes so close together illustrated two fundamental things to me about LIS education: first, the difficulty inherent in teaching both theoretical and practical aspects of a topic as broad as description and access in the course of a ten-week quarter; second, the deep parallels between archival and library work, and the ways in which knowledge of one expands and deepens knowledge of the other. I will take this understanding with me into future academic work teaching these subjects.

I have also been fortunate enough to gather experience in the field, both prior to my starting at UCLA and during my time here. Before coming to UCLA, I worked at an oral history nonprofit archive, the 1947 Partition Archive, as a digital archivist. During my time at UCLA, I also learned a significant amount during the year (2017-2018) that I worked with Shira Peltzman in the Digital Forensics Lab at UCLA Special Collections. At this job, I got a glimpse into the state of the art of born digital archives, having the opportunity to design 3D-printed housing for <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2441163">a 5.25” floppy disk drive</a>, contribute to the award-winning, multi-institution collaborative <a href="https://github.com/archivistsguidetokryoflux/archivists-guide-to-kryoflux#contributors">Archivists’ Guide to Kryoflux</a>, and develop guidelines for digital archiving using Forensics Toolkit (FTK). This job gave me extremely valuable hands-on experience in archives.

As a professor, I will also have the opportunity to mentor and advise PhD and MLIS students. The possibility of being able to guide PhD students through their intellectual development, honing my mentorship style, is very exciting for me. The small amount of mentorship I have already engaged in--with PhD students in cohorts below mine--has already been fulfilling for me. Likewise, devoting time to guiding MLIS students through their professional education, and learning from them, would be fulfilling as well.
