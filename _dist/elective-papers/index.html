These three papers show the depth and breadth that I have been able to cover in my MLIS program of study.</p><h2>The Truth is Out There: Examining Conspiracist Information Seeking in Archives</h2><p>This paper was originally written for IS 434: Archival Use & Users, taught by Prof. Michelle Caswell. It is related to the project presented in my issue paper: interview structures will be similar, though the research questions I am asking in this paper are different.</p><h3>Abstract</h3><p>As conspiracy theories move from the fringes of society to the mainstream, the empirical study of conspiracy theories, their formation, propagation, and rhetorical staying power, has accelerated. Such research has examined how conspiracy theories spread online; addressed the question of what conspiracists believe and why; asked epistemological questions of whether or not conspiracy theorizing is justifiable or reasonable as a form of sense-making; and characterized the socio-cultural effects of conspiracy theories. The project proposed in this research design paper examines the how of conspiracist information seeking within archives and/ or using archival materials. This paper first outlines the theoretical significance of the project (why does it matter how conspiracists do research?), grounding the project in archival theory, conspiracy theory scholarship, and information seeking. It will then outline the research design: using grounded theory-informed intensive interviewing, I will recruit and interview twenty-four to thirty conspiracist researchers who are looking into one of three conspiratorial subjects: the CIA program MK-ULTRA, the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and the Roswell Incident. Speaking directly to conspiracist researchers will allow for a more in-depth look at the particulars of conspiracist information seeking.</p><h2>Misinformation & Disinformation: A Review of the Literature</h2><p>This paper was written for Prof. Gregory Leazer's IS 213: Current Issues in Librarianship class. It also took place as an oral presentation, the slides for which can be found here.</p><h3>Abstract</h3><p>Since the end of 2016, the study of misinformation, disinformation, and how it spreads, has exploded in popularity as a subject for scholarly studies as well as journalistic inquiry. This literature review attempts to define key terms in this area, and examines the differences between political and journalistic misinformation, and scientific and health-related misinformation.</p></div></article><footer role="contentinfo"></footer></body></html>
